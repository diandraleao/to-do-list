## üí° Tecnologies
- Javascript
- React
- Styled-components

## üîê Available scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commandss:

```sh
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

```sh
npm build
```
Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

```sh
npm test
```
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) for more information.

```sh
npm eject
```
This project was been created using create-react-app, and CRA uses encapsulates all of the npm modules it is using internally, so that your package.json will be very clean and simple without you having to worry about it.

However, if you want to start doing more complex things and installing modules that may interact with modules create-react-app is using under the hood, those new modules need to know what is available and not, meaning you need to have create-react-app un-abstract them.

That, in essence, is what react-scripts eject does. It will stop hiding what it's got installed under the hood and instead eject those things into your project's package.json for everyone to see.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Install dependencies 

```sh
npm install
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execute project ‚Ää

```sh
npm start
```
The project will open at
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
